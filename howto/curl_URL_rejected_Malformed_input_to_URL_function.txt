$'\r' : command not found

You will need to use "percent encoding" in the URL to encode the special character.

For example, when testing an LDAP URL using curl, the below command will work in
previous versions of curl:

curl -v "ldap://[ip address]:389/OU=Active Service Accounts,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Co
However this will fail in the newer versions with the error "URL rejected: Malformed
input to a URL function". You will need to replace the space with "%20" like below:

curl -v ldap://[ip address]:389/OU=Active%20Service%20Accounts,OU=Service%20Accounts,
